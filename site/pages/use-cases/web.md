# The web

> **Planned.**

**In one line:** a `<livery-template>` element that fetches, verifies and plays a template with
rc-players' TypeScript player, fed by the same catalogs.

## The plan

- A TypeScript client (`fetch`, `crypto.subtle` Ed25519, Cache API storage) ported from the Kotlin
  one and checked against the shared conformance fixtures.
- A web component over `remote-compose-player-js`.

Today, the Kotlin client already compiles for Wasm (Ktor's `fetch` engine), and `livery-compose`
runs in the browser through Compose Multiplatform.

**Hosting for the web:** GitHub release downloads send no CORS headers, so a browser must read a
catalog from GitHub Pages, a CDN or a design server instead ([Hosting](../hosting.md)).

### npm releases

`@livery/a2ui` follows the repository version. Release-please updates its package and lockfile;
merging the release PR builds and checks the npm tarball, then publishes it alongside Maven.
The repository owner must configure `NPM_TOKEN` with publish access to `@livery/a2ui` before the
first npm release. No npm release has been made yet. `npm run pack:check` checks the files and
relative runtime imports in the actual tarball in CI. The TypeScript player remains vendored
with its provenance until rc-players publishes a supported npm package.

### React and Angular

The same session and controller power all three web renderers. Use
`liveryReactCatalog(session, options)` from `@livery/a2ui/react` with React's `A2uiSurface`, or
`liveryAngularCatalog(session, options)` from `@livery/a2ui/angular` with Angular's
`provideA2Ui({ catalogs: [catalog] })` and `SurfaceComponent`. Install the matching optional peers:
React 18/19 with `@a2ui/react` 0.15; Angular 21 with `@a2ui/angular` 0.14 (which uses web_core 0.15).
Angular applications also configure A2UI's `provideMarkdownRenderer()` for the basic components.
The Angular entry ships partial compilation for the application's Angular linker.

`options.base` extends the selected renderer's catalog. Actions, data-model paths, themes,
decision ids, retry and height behavior are shared. `fallback` returns a Lit template for Lit,
a React node for React, or a DOM node/string for Angular. `npm test` runs the same sample catalog
and all interaction checks once per renderer; `CHROMIUM_PATH` can select a local Chromium binary.
